PARALLELS VM MANAGER

This is a REST(ish) server to remotely manage Parallels VMs on an OS X box. This
is designed to work with Parallels Desktop. It exposes a bunch of resources to
perform basic operations on a VM like start, stop, read status of VM, revert to
snapshot etc. This is currently a work in progress & more resources will be added.

USAGE SCENARIO

This will be ideal in scenarios where you have a bunch of Mac Minis & want to use
them for automation. Install Parallels on each mini, install Parallels Virtualization
SDK & install this server. Now you can manage these VMs remotely with this
server. 

NOTE:

The Parallels Virtualization SDK listed on Parallels site is very old (as of this
writing), you should download following instead:

http://download.parallels.com/desktop/v7/ga-locales/ParallelsVirtualizationSDK-7.0.14922.693916.dmg

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

Future enhancements might include a master-slave setup where you have a
controller & these managers automatically register with the controller through
which you can control all the VMs.

LICENSE

This project uses Bottle to provide the HTTP server functionality & is included
